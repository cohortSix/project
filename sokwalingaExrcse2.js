/**
This code returns a sytanx error when run.
This is because function - coursework does not have a closing brace (}) 
which goes against Javascript syntax for defining functions. 
Placing a closing curly brace (}) for the function coursework will make this code run without running into a syntax error.

It is also good practice to put a termination (;) at the end of statements say after calling fnal function.
However, Javascript being a 'friendly' language, abscence of the termination won't stop the code from running.
